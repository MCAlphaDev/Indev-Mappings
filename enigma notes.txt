# CONVENTIONS
follow notch's packaging
fromTag/toTag
suffix naming (I bet I used a ton of prefix naming I'll need to change it maybe - but not urgent so not actively searching for it)
Entities and Block Entities have no suffix. Also items because there's so few of them and they don't really conflict
builders -> no prefix.
usually setItem/getItem with ItemStack
NZ english (might consider changing it later but for now I'm a kiwi so may as well)
